Input file type: .txt

Structure for input files:

typedef is used for structures
 
define the structure for job 
5 character using typedef/variables
Job No : Description : MachineNo : Duration : ClientName

define the structure for schedule
Job No : MachineNo : Start : End

define the structure for jobSchedule
Job No : Description : MachineNo : Duration : ClientName : Start : End


#1 main() takes files as CML argument

1. Take multiple files as a input from user : in main()
2. Send one file at a time in Joblist() function.
3. Create joblists for each file, calling joblist().
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all files are read.


#2 Function readFile

readFile: Reads file and add to joblist 
Open a file using function fopen() and store the file File pointer.
 Read content of file using functions fgets()
 Ex: J001:pipe bending:m1:45:expert accessories 
J002:surface cleaning:m2:30:nice part maker


#3 findDisplayAndRemoveInvalidJobs
 when description is empty,
 when machine no is less than 2,
 when duration is less than 1,
 when client name is empty the job is invalid

#4 Function schedule Jobs (void scheduleJob(job *jobList,int jobCount,
    schedule *scheduleList,int *scheduleCount))
This function scheduleJobs based on jobList, jobCount, scheduleList, scheduleCount;

#5 void groupScheduleList(schedule *scheduleList,int scheduleCount,
    machineSchedule *machineScheduleList,int *machineScheduleCount)
1. Open Schedule files for each machine in read and write mode to make entry of incoming
schedule updates.

#6 void writeSchedule (machineSchedule *machineScheduleList,
    int machineScheduleCount)
write schedule from groupScheduleList by using machineScheduleList, machineScheduleCount

#7 invalidFile(char *)

1. Open invalidRecord.txt in “a+” mode, add incoming invalid inputs.
2. Put a lock because multiple lists may use it to access invalidRecord file and each
invalid record should be preserved.
